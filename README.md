# Intro to Python for Text and Data

Instructor: [Allison Parrish](http://www.decontextualize.com/)

The goal of this course is to introduce students to essential techniques in
working with text and data and to enhance their literacy in the language and
practice of contemporary computer programming. Students will learn the Python
programming language from scratch, and work toward making a small final project
that meaningfully contributes to their interests and practice. Covered topics:
working on the command line, Jupyter Notebook, data formats (CSV and JSON),
Pandas, web scraping, text analysis with Natural Language Processing, Git and
Github.

## Schedule

### Session 1

* Introduction
* [Text processing on the command line](http://rwet.decontextualize.com/book/unix/)
* Suggested exercise: [UNIX command line
  exercise](https://gist.github.com/aparrish/30cf87e287a4e3652342)
* Collaborate to make a list of data journalism, data science and text analysis
  projects that are meaningful and aspirational for you.
